Notes to recreate and sync development environments

- ***Was using sdkman for Scala and Java*** <br/>

- ***Try asdf for multiple language management and syncing*** <br/>

  ***Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool, extendable via plugins - docs at asdf-vm.com*** <br/>
  asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is like gvm, nvm, rbenv & pyenv (and more) all in one! Simply      install your language's plugin!
